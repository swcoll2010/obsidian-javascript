This is the version control file that twins with the [[package.json]] file.

This file locks the version of all the dependencies of the packages installed. This allows you to restore the project to a specific version, guaranteeing that it will restore and build on different targets.

For continous integration, you can use the npm ci [[NPM Commands]], for build and integration systems like Travis.
